# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    
  schedule:
    - cron: "10 0 * * *"
    #定时8点10分，但是有延迟，估计会到9点的样子提醒
    
#要定时的时间+8  
#这个意思就是定时每天的14点 但因为这个是国际协调时间UTC 
#我们比它晚8个小时，所以对我们来说就是定时每天22点的时候 
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
 # workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 当有name之后了，后面的run和uses不能加-
      #这里用空格换行，每行空格保持一致就可以
